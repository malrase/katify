katify
======

Katify(tm) is a new way to liven up your project and/or website with Instagrammed pictures of our cat, Kate.

Just use the function `katify(Text %xpath, Text %num)`, where %xpath is a path to the image you want to replace and %num is a digit from 0-9.

## Example

    katify("//image", "6")

## Upcoming Features

- Randomised picture of Kate appears instead of a specified one
